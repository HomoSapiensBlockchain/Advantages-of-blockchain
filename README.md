# Advantages of blockchain

Blockchain is a distributed database that maintains an expandable ledger of data and records. This ledger is encrypted and protected from tampering, overhaul and deletion. The blocks that make up the blockchain, processed continuously over time, contain hashes that link and indicate important information in the database. The mix of transactions, blocks and decentralization of data in the ledger allows for great opportunities in several areas.

# Nascent technology

Solving challenges such as transaction speed, verification process, and data limits will be crucial to make blockchain widely applicable.

 #   Unstable regulatory state

Since modern currencies have always been created and regulated by national governments, blockchain and bitcoin will face obstacles in widespread adoption by preexisting financial institutions if their government regulation remains unstable.

 #   Large power consumption

Bitcoin's blockchain network miners are trying trillions of solutions per second in efforts to validate transactions using a substantial amount of computing power.

 #   Control, security and privacy

While solutions exist, including private and permissionada blockchain and strong encryption, there are still cyber security issues that need to be resolved before the general public entrusts their personal data to a blockchain solution.

 #   Integration Issues

Blockchain applications offer solutions that require significant changes, or the complete replacement of existing systems. In order to realize the exchange, companies need to develop a transition strategy.

 #   Cultural Adoption

Blockchain represents a complete exchange for a decentralized network that requires the participation of its users and operators.

  #  Cost

Blockchain offers great savings in price and time per transaction but the high initial capital costs can be a deterrent.
